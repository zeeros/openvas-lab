Before using the VMs be sure to have them connected through a host-only network: we don't want to expose our VMs to the network, especially the vulnerable target. To setup a ~Host-only Adapter~
- Go to ~File > Host Network Manager...~
- Click on ~Create~, take note of the name of the adapter (e.g. ~voboxnet0~)
- Click on ~Properties > DHCP Server > Enable Server~
- Click ~Apply~ and close the window

To connect a VM select it and go to ~Settings > Network~. On the tab ~Adapter 1~ set ~Attached to: Host-only Adapter~ and set the right adapter (e.g. ~voboxnet0~). Start the virtual machine.
