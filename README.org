#+title: OpenVAS Lab - Network Security

Notes for the OpenVAS lab for the Network Security class.

* Introduction

[[./openvas-gvm.jpg]]

OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanner) is [fn:1]
- A full-featured scan engine that executes a continuously updated and extended feed of Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs).
- Part of GVM (Greenbone Vulnerability Management)

OpenVAS can use two daily updated feeds
- GCF :: Greenbone Community Feed, available with the free version
- GSF :: Greenbone Security Feed, available with the paid version. Includes advanced NVTs to target enterprise environments.

* Setting up the lab

We are going to use
- Oracle VM VirtualBox 6.1.16 (download [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][here]])
- GSM TRIAL 20.08.8 (download [[https://www.greenbone.net/en/testnow/#toggle-id-4-closed][here]])
- Metasploitable 2 (download [[https://information.rapid7.com/download-metasploitable-2017.html][here]])

Before proceding with the VMs creation, be sure to have a ~Host-only Adapter~ already set: we don't want to expose our VMs to the web, especially the vulnerable one. To setup a ~Host-only Adapter~
- Go to ~File > Host Network Manager...~
- Click on ~New~, take note of the name of the adapter (e.g. ~voboxnet0~)

The final result will be a ~.ova~ file containing two VMs: one for GSM, the other for Metasploitable 2

** OpenVAS VM setup [fn:2]

1. Import the GSM TRIAL image from VirtualBox and select it go to Settings > Network. On the tab "Adapter 1" set "Attached to:" to "Host-only Adapter" and set the adapter (e.g. ~voboxnet0~). Start the virtual machine.
2. The Greenbone OS is loaded. To access the Greenbone Administration panel log in with username ~admin~ and password ~admin~.
3. At the first log in, a First Setup Wizard is visualized, select "Yes" to continue.
4. It is asked whether a web user should be created. This is required to use the web interface, select "Yes" and input account name ~admin~ and password ~admin~. Select OK, a message informs the user that the web administrator has been created, and again select OK to close the message.
5. Since we have no valid GSF subscription key, the appliance only uses the public Greenbone Community Feed (GCF) and not the Greenbone Security Feed (GSF). Skip the the subscription key dialog.
6. A status check is performed, and the manager is ready to be used.
7. Logout from the the administration panel. In the welcome screen, take note of the IP address used by the web interface (e.g. ~192.168.56.102~) and shut down the VM.
8. From the host machine, open a browser and connect to the noted IP address (e.g. https://192.168.56.102). After accepting the self-signed certificate, access the web interface and login with the previously set credentials (username ~admin~, password ~admin~).

** Metasploitable2 VM setup [fn:3] [fn:4]

Metasploitable 2 is an intentionally vulnerable Ubuntu Linux virtual machine that is designed for testing common vulnerabilities. The metasploitable ISO is VMWare format.

1. Unzip the file and create a new VM: choose Linux->Ubuntu (64bit), give it at least at least 1024MB RAM and do not create a HDD. Wait and add the disk *.vmdk. Select the new VM and go to Settings > Network. On the tab "Adapter 1" set "Attached to:" to "Host-only Adapter" and set the adapter (e.g. ~voboxnet0~). Start the virtual machine.
2. Login using the credentials ~msfadmin:msfadmin~ and with ~ifconfig~ retrieve the IP address assigned to the VM
3. From the host machine, open a browser and connect to the noted IP address (e.g. https://192.168.56.101). After accepting the self-signed certificate, access the web interface: a metasploitable2 web page should be displayed.

* Exercises

With the VMs already setup, we can access to the following environments
- Greenbone Administration panel :: ~admin:admin~
- Greenbone Web panel :: ~admin:admin~
- Metasploitable2 panel :: ~msfadmin:msfadmin~

** TODO Exercise 1
** TODO Exercise 2
** TODO Exercise 3
